# ID Scanning Guide for IconInk

## Overview

The ID scanning feature allows tattoo and piercing professionals to quickly capture and extract information from client identification documents. This guide explains how to use the ID scanning features, how they work behind the scenes, and best practices for ensuring accurate scans.

## User Guide

### Scanning an ID

1. Navigate to the "Scanner" tab in the app
2. Select an existing client or create a new one
3. Tap "Scan ID Document" to open the camera
4. Position the ID within the frame guide on the screen
5. Ensure the ID is well-lit and the text is clearly visible
6. Tap the capture button to take a photo
7. Review the captured image and extracted information
8. If the information looks correct, tap "Use This Information"
9. If needed, scan the back of the ID by tapping "Scan Again"

### Tips for Successful Scans

- **Lighting**: Ensure the ID is well-lit without glare or shadows
- **Focus**: Hold the device steady and ensure the ID is in focus
- **Framing**: Position the entire ID within the frame guide
- **Orientation**: Keep the ID straight (not angled)
- **Distance**: Hold the device approximately 6-8 inches from the ID
- **Background**: Use a dark, solid background for best contrast

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Blurry scan | Hold the device more steady or improve lighting |
| Text not recognized | Ensure ID is clean, well-lit, and positioned properly |
| Missing information | Try rescanning or manually entering the information |
| Incorrect information | Edit the extracted information before saving |
| Scan fails repeatedly | Enter information manually or check camera permissions |

## Technical Documentation

### Architecture

The ID scanning feature consists of several components:

1. **UI Layer**: `IDScannerView` and `CameraView` for user interaction
2. **Processing Layer**: `IDScanner` class for image processing and text extraction
3. **Data Layer**: CoreData integration for storing extracted information
4. **Security Layer**: `SecurityManager` for encrypting sensitive information

### Key Components

#### IDScanner Class

The `IDScanner` class is responsible for processing images and extracting information from IDs. It uses Apple's Vision framework for text recognition and provides robust validation and error handling.

Key methods:
- `scanID(from:completion:)`: Processes an image and extracts ID information
- `assessImageQuality(_:)`: Determines if an image is suitable for processing
- `validateExtractedInfo(_:)`: Ensures extracted information meets minimum requirements
- `parseIDInformation(from:)`: Extracts structured information from recognized text

#### IDScannerView

The `IDScannerView` is the primary user interface for ID scanning. It handles:
- Displaying the camera preview
- Guiding users with frame overlays
- Showing extracted information
- Providing feedback on scan quality and results
- Handling user interaction for accepting or retrying scans

#### ID Scanning Process Flow

1. User captures an image using the camera
2. Image quality is assessed (resolution, blur, brightness)
3. If quality is sufficient, text recognition is performed
4. Recognized text is parsed to extract structured information
5. Extracted information is validated for completeness
6. Results are displayed to the user for confirmation
7. Confirmed information is saved to the database

### Data Security

All sensitive information extracted from IDs is handled securely:

- Information is stored only on the device (no cloud transmission)
- Sensitive fields can be encrypted using AES-GCM encryption
- Data access requires authentication when app lock is enabled
- Images and data are protected by the device's file protection

### Error Handling

The ID scanning feature includes comprehensive error handling:

- Image quality issues: Detects and reports poor lighting, blur, or low resolution
- Recognition errors: Handles text recognition failures gracefully
- Validation errors: Ensures minimum required information is present
- User-friendly error messages: Provides actionable feedback to users

## Best Practices for Developers

When modifying the ID scanning functionality, follow these guidelines:

1. **Privacy First**: Never transmit ID information off the device
2. **Error Handling**: Always provide clear feedback for scan issues
3. **Validation**: Maintain strict validation of extracted information
4. **Security**: Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted
5. **Performance**: Optimize image processing for faster scanning
6. **Accessibility**: Maintain clear guidance for users with accessibility needs

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the ID scanning feature:

1. Support for additional ID types (passports, military IDs)
2. Enhanced validation with barcode/QR code scanning
3. Improved address parsing for better accuracy
4. AI-powered forgery detection
5. Batch scanning for multiple documents

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Codes

| Error Type | Description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `imageConversion` | Failed to process image format | Try again with better lighting |
| `poorQuality` | Image quality too low | Improve lighting and stability |
| `noTextFound` | No text detected in image | Ensure ID is visible and text is clear |
| `recognitionFailed` | Text recognition process failed | Retry with better positioning |
| `invalidIDFormat` | Text doesn't match ID format | Ensure this is a valid ID document |
| `requestFailed` | Vision request processing failed | Restart the app and try again |
| `lowConfidence` | Text recognition uncertain | Improve lighting and focus |
| `missingRequiredFields` | Required information missing | Try scanning both sides of ID |
